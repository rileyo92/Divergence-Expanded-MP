EVTDESC500059;"We do not seek the destruction of any government, nor do we covet a foot of any territory. We do not want an expanding struggle with consequences that no one can perceive, nor will we bluster or bully or flaunt our power, but we will not surrender."\n\nFinishing his speech, the ambassador of one of the Great Powers that gathered to discuss the situation of our country finished convincing the other great powers to sign a round of economical and diplomatic sanctions against our country. The Great Power conference sent us a warning against any more aggression from our part and said they are ready to escalate if we don't cease and change our behavior.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
